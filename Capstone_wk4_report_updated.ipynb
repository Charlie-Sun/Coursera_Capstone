Opening a restaurant requires a lot of upfront investment and continuous cost, which requires the restaurant to have a stable source of customers in the course of operation. The main source of guests should be the surrounding communities. Therefore, analyzing location data makes a lot of sense. Location data from Foursquare also reveals the number of existing restaurants and similar food and beverage services in different locations, minimizing the problem of excessive competition in choosing locations for new restaurants. \n\nIt is worth noting that this project is focusing on a Chinese restaurant, it's also important to consider different people\u2019s preference for food. People from the same region may have similar tastes. In other words, potential customers of Chinese restaurants are also likely to be regular customers of Thai, Japanese and other Asian restaurants. So, when analyzing location data, it makes sense to consider these Asian restaurant data. \n\nIn a word, the question for this project is: in Boston, United States, if someone wants to open a new Chinese  Restaurant, which location would you recommend?

Location will significantly affect the operation of a restaurant. Whether there are too few restaurants in a location to create a business cluster, or too many restaurants to increase competition, it can affect the operation of a new restaurant. Also, the taste of the residents in the area where the restaurant is located is another factor. Therefore, a clear perception of all investor locations in the Boston neighborhoods is necessary for the intended audience of this project.
